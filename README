1. Employ password protection
   • Edit conf files for both Apache and Nginx
   • link to Apache conf file: https://github.com/wuyyyying/CSE135-HW1/blob/master/000-default.conf
   • link to Ngnix conf file: https://github.com/wuyyyying/CSE135-HW1/blob/master/default
   • Store the username and encrypted password pair in the file .htpasswd
2. Have a static team page that indicates your name and/or team members, email, etc
   index.html link: https://github.com/wuyyyying/CSE135-HW1/blob/master/index.html
3. Use custom error pages
   • Edit conf files for both Apache and Nginx
   • custom_404.html link: https://github.com/wuyyyying/CSE135-HW1/blob/master/custom_404.html
   • custom_403.html link: https://github.com/wuyyyying/CSE135-HW1/blob/master/custom_403.html
4. Have a favicon
   Please refer to file index.html
5. Have a robots.txt file
   • A minimal format that blocks the robot to visit any of the page
   • robots.txt link: https://github.com/wuyyyying/CSE135-HW1/blob/master/robots.txt
   • The "User-agent: *" means this section applies to all robots. The "Disallow: /" tells the robot that it should not visit any pages on the site. 
6. Deploy from Github
   • create an empty directory and then run the following command:
       git init
       git remote add live ssh://root@157.230.57.144/var/repo/site.git
       git pull live master
   • then we can change the files locally and push the changes to the server by running the command
       git push live master 
7. Log Properly
   • We use GoAccess to analyze our access.log for both Apache and Nginx
   • The detailed command is 
	goaccess access.log -o report.html --log-format=COMBINED
   • report.html is the statistics report generated based on access.log file
   • You can find the link on the CSE135-HW1.pdf
8. Compress Textual Content
   Please refer to CSE135-HW1.pdf Reports section
9. Obscure server identity
   Please refer to CSE135-HW1.pdf Reports section
10. Run PHP
   append /info.php at the end of url to see result
11. Deliver Clean URLs
   • Aiming for **extra credit**: http://157.230.57.144:8081/index.html will redirect to http://157.230.57.144:8081/index
   • We manage to hide extension(.html and .php) and redirect the page to an existing file matching the prefix.
   • Simply type in the page user desires to see and you can see result.(ex http://157.230.57.144:8081/index)
